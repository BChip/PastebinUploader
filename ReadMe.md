This is the logic behind my Pastebin Uploader. The purpose of this program is to copy-cat the application Gyazo, but with text. The program takes whatever is in your clipboard and automatically uploads it to Pastebin and returns the URL to your new Paste! In the code, you can see all pastes are going to be uploaded as unlisted and have an expiration date of two weeks.
